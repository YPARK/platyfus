              diseases and traits (average N = 169,331) and found significant

              mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood
              phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the
              analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes
              associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single
              function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here
              we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the
              phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions,
              finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance.
              We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by
              common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to
              biological process classifications, synthetic lethal
              interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis

              functions. Applying these functional classifications to

  abstract = "We performed a genome-wide scan for genetic variants that
              influence multiple human phenotypes by comparing large
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 40 traits or diseases,
              including anthropometric traits (e.g. nose size and male pattern
              baldness), immune traits (e.g. susceptibility to childhood ear
              infections and Crohn9s disease), metabolic phenotypes (e.g. type
              2 diabetes and lipid levels), and psychiatric diseases (e.g.
              schizophrenia and Parkinson9s disease). First, we identified 307
              loci (at a false discovery rate of 10\%) that influence multiple
              traits (excluding ``trivial'' phenotype pairs like type 2
              diabetes and fasting glucose). Several loci influence a large
              number of phenotypes; for example, variants near the blood group
              gene ABO influence eleven of these traits, including risk of
              childhood ear infections (rs635634: log-odds ratio = 0.06, P =
              1.4 $\times$ 10−8) and allergies (log-odds ratio = 0.05, P = 2.5
              $\times$ 10−8), among others. Similarly, a nonsynonymous variant
              in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of these traits,
              including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-odds ratio =
              0.15, P = 2 $\times$ 10−12) and Parkinson's disease (log-odds
              ratio = -0.15, P = 1.6 $\times$ 10−7), among others. Second, we
              used these loci to identify traits that share multiple genetic
              causes in common. For example, genetic variants that delay age of
              menarche in women also, on average, delay age of voice drop in
              men, decrease body mass index (BMI), increase adult height, and
              decrease risk of male pattern baldness. Finally, we identified
              four pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship.
              For example, we show evidence that increased BMI causally
              increases triglyceride levels, and that increased liability to
              hypothyroidism causally decreases adult height.",

               discover the coordinated control of these traits via genotyped
               polymorphisms. A common statistical approach to this problem
               involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and
               each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually (PHN);
               and taking a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of
               independent tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a
               dimension reduction technique, such as estimation of principal
               components, and test for an association with the principal
               components of the phenotypes (PCP) rather than the individual
               phenotypes. Building on the work of Lange and colleagues we
               develop an alternative method based on the principal component
               of heritability (PCH). For each SNP the PCH approach reduces the
               phenotypes to a single trait that has a higher heritability than
               any other linear combination of the phenotypes. As a result, the
               association between a SNP and derived trait is often easier to
               detect than an association with any of the individual phenotypes
               or the PCP. When applied to unrelated subjects, PCH has a
               drawback. For each SNP it is necessary to estimate the vector of
               loadings that maximize the heritability over all phenotypes. We
               develop a method of iterated sample splitting that uses one
               portion of the data for training and the remainder for testing.
               This cross-validation approach maintains the type I error

               Genomes) is a widely used approach for increasing power in
               genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis. Existing
               hidden Markov models (HMM)-based imputation approaches require
               individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for
               Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type
               of data that is becoming widely available. RESULTS:In
               simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this method
               recovers 84\% (54\%) of the effective sample size for common
               (>5\%) and low-frequency (1-5\%) variants [increasing to 87\%
               (60\%) when summary linkage disequilibrium information is
               available from target samples] versus the gold standard of 89\%
               (67\%) for HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied to
               summary statistics. Our approach accounts for the limited sample
               size of the reference panel, a crucial step to eliminate
               false-positive associations, and it is computationally very
               fast. As an empirical demonstration, we apply our method to
               seven case-control phenotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case
               Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and a study of height in the
               British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC). Gaussian imputation from
               summary statistics recovers 95\% (105\%) of the effective sample
               size (as quantified by the ratio of [Formula: see text]
               association statistics) compared with HMM-based imputation from
               individual-level genotypes at the 227 (176) published single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WTCCC (1958BC height)
               data. In addition, for publicly available summary statistics
               from large meta-analyses of four lipid traits, we publicly
               release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which could
               not have been obtained using previously published methods, and
               demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We
               show that 1000G imputation using our approach increases the
               magnitude and statistical evidence of enrichment at genic versus
               non-genic loci for these traits, as compared with an analysis
               without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics
               will be a valuable tool in future functional enrichment

              we demonstrate the value of this resource for improving
              imputation accuracy at rare and low-frequency variants in both a
              UK and an Italian population. We show that large increases in
              imputation accuracy can be achieved by re-phasing WGS reference
              panels after initial genotype calling. We also present a method
              for combining WGS panels to improve variant coverage and
              downstream imputation accuracy, which we illustrate by
              integrating 7,562 WGS haplotypes from the UK10K project with
              2,184 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project. Finally, we
              introduce a novel approximation that maintains speed without
              sacrificing imputation accuracy for rare variants.",

              acquire comprehensive insights into the underlying genetics, here
              we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 58
              quantitative traits in 162,255 Japanese individuals. Overall, we
              identified 1,407 trait-associated loci (P < 5.0 $\times$ 10−8),
              679 of which were novel. By incorporating 32 additional GWAS
              results for complex diseases and traits in Japanese individuals,
              we further highlighted pleiotropy, genetic correlations, and
              cell-type specificity across quantitative traits and diseases,
              which substantially expands the current understanding of the
              associated genetics and biology. This study identified both
              shared polygenic effects and cell-type specificity, represented
              by the genetic links among clinical measurements, complex
              diseases, and relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate that
              even without prior biological knowledge of cross-phenotype
              relationships, genetics corresponding to clinical measurements
              successfully recapture those measurements' relevance to diseases,

              practical to identify family members of cases. In randomly

              relatives enables studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly
              absent) in the cohort. We refer to this approach as genome-wide

              opportunities for assessing quality issues, although the wide
              range of ancestries of the individuals in the cohort also creates
              particular challenges. We also conducted a set of analyses that
              reveal properties of the genetic data (such as population
              structure and relatedness) that can be important for downstream
              analyses. In addition, we phased and imputed genotypes into the

              the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K haplotype

              signals of known associations between HLA alleles and many common
