              mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood
              phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the
              analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes

              function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here
              we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the
              phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions,
              finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance.
              We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by
              common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to
              biological process classifications, synthetic lethal
              interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis

               discover the coordinated control of these traits via genotyped
               polymorphisms. A common statistical approach to this problem
               involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and
               each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually (PHN);
               and taking a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of
               independent tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a
               dimension reduction technique, such as estimation of principal
               components, and test for an association with the principal
               components of the phenotypes (PCP) rather than the individual
               phenotypes. Building on the work of Lange and colleagues we
               develop an alternative method based on the principal component
               of heritability (PCH). For each SNP the PCH approach reduces the
               phenotypes to a single trait that has a higher heritability than
               any other linear combination of the phenotypes. As a result, the
               association between a SNP and derived trait is often easier to
               detect than an association with any of the individual phenotypes
               or the PCP. When applied to unrelated subjects, PCH has a
               drawback. For each SNP it is necessary to estimate the vector of
               loadings that maximize the heritability over all phenotypes. We
               develop a method of iterated sample splitting that uses one
               portion of the data for training and the remainder for testing.
               This cross-validation approach maintains the type I error
               control and yet utilizes the data efficiently, resulting in a
